For the game scene.I created the background myself using adobe Ai and PS and the arts have been sold to an indie horror game website including the 5 dark trees , the darkbackground,all the platforms ,grasses.But I do not own the animation and sprites of the enimies nor the background of the mainpage.Thaâ€™s why I cannot put the mainpage as the first page.
